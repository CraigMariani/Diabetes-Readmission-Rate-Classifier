The following queries are designed to compare the readmission rates to the hospitals resources.

readmission_rate_vs_number_inpatient
Segments patients by how many times they’ve been inpatient before.
Calculates total patients, how many were readmitted, and the readmission rate per group.
Helps you spot if patients with more inpatient visits tend to return more.

Higher number_inpatiet = higher readmission rate

Purpose: Segments patients by how many prior inpatient visits they had.

Goal: Determine if previous inpatient frequency correlates with future readmissions.

Observation: There is a clear trend — patients with a higher number of inpatient visits tend to have higher readmission rates.


readmission_rate_vs_number_emergency
Segments patients by how many times they’ve had emergencies before.
Calculates total patients, how many were readmitted, and the readmission rate per group.
Helps you spot if patients with more emergencies tend to return more.

There might be a trend by looking at the data file itself but its hard to say at the moment 

Purpose: Analyzes how emergency visits relate to readmission likelihood.

Goal: Identify if frequent ER visits are a predictive factor.

Observation: A trend might exist, but the relationship is less obvious. A more detailed analysis (e.g., visualization or logistic regression) may be needed.


readmission_rate_vs_number_lab_procedure
Buckets number of lab procedures into tables,
Possible increasing trend with readmission rate and number of lab procedures

Purpose: Buckets number of lab procedures into ranges to assess their relationship with readmission.

Goal: Explore whether more diagnostic effort signals higher risk.

Observation: There appears to be a possible increasing trend — more lab procedures may correlate with higher readmission rates, potentially due to case complexity.

readmission_rate_vs_number_medications
Buckets number of medications into tables 
No trend found 

Purpose: Analyzes patients based on how many medications they were prescribed.

Goal: Understand whether polypharmacy is linked to readmission.

Observation: No clear trend observed — the number of medications does not show a strong correlation with readmission rates in this dataset.
